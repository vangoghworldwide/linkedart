# Data mapping 
[The Van Gogh Worldwide data guidelines](../README.md) describe how to provide data according to the Linked Art data model. For museums this means they need to translate their collection data to the Linked Art data model. This process is often called a data mapping.

Spinque provides tools to create such mappings. These tools are based on XSLT transformations. The Spinque documentation provides a starting point to learn about the [mapping language](https://docs.spinque.com/3.0/data-mapping/mapping-language.html) and the process of [data virtualization](https://docs.spinque.com/3.0/desk/getting-started-data-virtualization.html) that the data mapping is a part of.
